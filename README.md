# dsw-department-of-student-welfare-management-system

This is a semester project of CUET. To run this program, the following steps need to follow:

- The login window requires admin username and password.
initially username "root" and and password "pass" can be used. Then new account can be added.

- There are 4 tables in database. One for Login, one for student record, one for Offense and verdicts record and one for certificate issue record.

- C# is used for GUI and coding, and MySql is used for database store and query. 

- The student database will contain the the important info that is available in academy. so, it will not be needed to search the papers for information. 

- Student records can be searched by any of the information from the given fields including ID, student name, dept, Father's name, contact info, etc. 

- The character certificate can be issued and delivered easily after seeing the search result.

- there is an option for "count issued and delived certificate" for each student to store the amount of issued and delivered certificate.

- The database is included with the attached file.

- The dashboard form was the main form. then other "user control" forms are added within the panel. 

- Microsoft visual studio is used as IDE. we used phpMyadmin for database purpose. 

- as the non-technical people will handle this software, we tried to make it user friendly. 

- As we built this software from the scratch, it may not be enrich with functions, but students can work in this software in future.
